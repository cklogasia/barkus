# Enhanced Barkus PDF Barcode Splitter

## Overview

The Enhanced Barkus PDF Barcode Splitter is a professional-grade tool that intelligently processes PDF documents by detecting barcodes and splitting them into separate files. This enhanced version provides advanced barcode detection capabilities with comprehensive status tracking and sophisticated page assignment logic.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Barcode Detection State Tracking

The enhanced system now differentiates between various barcode detection scenarios:

- **No Patterns Found**: Truly empty pages with no barcode-like patterns
- **Patterns Unreadable**: Barcode patterns detected but cannot be decoded
- **Patterns Corrupted**: Barcode patterns found but contain invalid/empty data
- **Success**: Barcodes successfully detected and classified
- **Retry Exhausted**: Maximum retry attempts reached without success

### 2. Enhanced Sequential Logic

The `--handle-no-barcode sequential` flag now works correctly:

- Pages without barcodes are appended to the **previous** PDF (not the last seen barcode)
- When a new barcode is detected, it starts a new group
- Pages continue to be assigned to the current group until a new barcode is found
- Provides detailed logging of assignment reasons

### 3. Intelligent Retry Logic

- **Progressive Image Enhancement**: Applies different enhancement techniques on retry attempts
- **Smart Retry Decision**: Only retries when patterns are detected but unreadable
- **Result Comparison**: Keeps track of the best detection result across attempts
- **Configurable Retry Count**: Adjustable maximum retry attempts

### 4. Comprehensive Error Reporting

- **Detailed Status Information**: Each page gets a complete detection status
- **Pattern Statistics**: Reports both total patterns found and readable patterns
- **Error Categorization**: Distinguishes between different types of failures
- **Enhanced Logging**: Debug, info, warning, and error levels with timestamps

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage
uv run python barkus_main.py input.pdf

# Enhanced sequential mode with detailed logging
uv run python barkus_main.py input.pdf --handle-no-barcode sequential --log-file process.log

# High DPI processing with debug output
uv run python barkus_main.py input.pdf --dpi 600 --debug

# All options
uv run python barkus_main.py input.pdf \
    --output-dir results \
    --handle-no-barcode sequential \
    --dpi 600 \
    --log-file detailed.log \
    --debug
```

### Handle No Barcode Options

1. **`ignore`** (default): Skip pages without barcodes
2. **`separate`**: Create a separate PDF for pages without barcodes
3. **`keep_with_previous`**: Include pages with the previous barcode group
4. **`sequential`**: Include pages with the last detected barcode until a new one is found

## Architecture

### Modular Design

The enhanced system follows Clean Code principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
barkus_modules/
├── application.py          # Main application orchestration
├── barcode_detector.py     # Enhanced barcode detection with state tracking
├── pdf_processor.py        # PDF processing with improved sequential logic
├── file_operations.py      # File I/O operations
└── logging_handler.py      # Comprehensive logging with debug support
```

### Key Classes

#### `BarcodeDetectionResult`
```python
@dataclass
class BarcodeDetectionResult:
    delivery_number: Optional[str] = None
    customer_name: Optional[str] = None
    detection_status: BarcodeDetectionStatus = BarcodeDetectionStatus.NO_PATTERNS_FOUND
    patterns_found: int = 0
    readable_patterns: int = 0
    retry_count: int = 0
    error_details: Optional[str] = None
```

#### `BarcodeDetectionStatus`
```python
class BarcodeDetectionStatus(Enum):
    SUCCESS = "success"
    NO_PATTERNS_FOUND = "no_patterns_found"
    PATTERNS_UNREADABLE = "patterns_unreadable"
    PATTERNS_CORRUPTED = "patterns_corrupted"
    MULTIPLE_CONFLICTS = "multiple_conflicts"
    RETRY_EXHAUSTED = "retry_exhausted"
```

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Pattern Detection Algorithm

The system now uses a two-stage detection approach:

1. **Standard Detection**: Uses ZXing-CPP for barcode reading
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Uses OpenCV to detect potential barcode regions even when they're unreadable

This allows the system to distinguish between:
- Pages with no barcode patterns at all
- Pages with barcode patterns that are corrupted or unreadable

### 2. Image Enhancement Pipeline

Progressive enhancement techniques applied during retry attempts:

- **Level 0**: Original image (no enhancement)
- **Level 1**: Histogram equalization for contrast enhancement
- **Level 2**: Gaussian blur to reduce noise
- **Level 3**: Morphological operations for cleanup

### 3. Intelligent Result Comparison

The system maintains the best detection result across retry attempts using priority rules:

1. Complete barcodes (both delivery number and customer name)
2. More barcodes found (partial success)
3. Better detection status
4. More readable patterns

### 4. Enhanced Sequential Assignment

The corrected sequential logic now properly handles the workflow:

```python
# Correct sequential behavior:
# Page 1: Barcode A detected → starts group A
# Page 2: No barcode → assigned to group A
# Page 3: No barcode → assigned to group A
# Page 4: Barcode B detected → starts group B
# Page 5: No barcode → assigned to group B
```

## Statistics and Reporting

The enhanced system provides comprehensive statistics:

```python
stats = {
    'total_pages': 100,
    'pages_with_barcodes': 85,
    'pages_complete_barcodes': 80,
    'pages_no_patterns': 10,
    'pages_unreadable_patterns': 3,
    'pages_corrupted_patterns': 2,
    'pages_retry_exhausted': 0,
    'total_patterns_found': 170,
    'total_readable_patterns': 165
}
```

## Testing

The enhanced system includes comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run python test_enhanced_barkus.py

# Run with verbose output
uv run python test_enhanced_barkus.py -v
```

- Automatic cleanup of temporary images
- Efficient pattern detection algorithms

### Processing Speed
- Intelligent retry logic that skips unnecessary attempts
- Progressive image enhancement only when needed
- Parallel processing opportunities for large documents

## Dependencies

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Results
1. Use DPI 300-600 for best barcode detection
2. Enable debug logging for troubleshooting
3. Use sequential mode for documents with mixed pages
4. Review detection statistics for quality assessment

### Troubleshooting
1. Check the detailed log file for specific error messages
2. Review detection statistics to understand failure patterns
